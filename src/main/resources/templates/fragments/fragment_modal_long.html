                        I always felt like I could do anything. That’s the main thing people are controlled by!
                        Thoughts- their perception of themselves! They're slowed down by their perception of themselves.
                        If you're taught you can’t do anything, you won’t do anything. I was taught I could do
                        everything.
                        <br/><br/>
                        As we live, our hearts turn colder. Cause pain is what we go through as we become older. We get
                        insulted by others, lose trust for those others. We get back stabbed by friends. It becomes
                        harder for us to give others a hand. We get our heart broken by people we love, even that we
                        give them all we have. Then we lose family over time. What else could rust the heart more over
                        time? Blackgold.

                        We’re not always in the position that we want to be at. We’re constantly growing. We’re
                        constantly making mistakes. We’re constantly trying to express ourselves and actualize our
                        dreams. If you have the opportunity to play this game of life you need to appreciate every
                        moment. A lot of people don’t appreciate the moment until it’s passed.
                        <br/><br/>


                        There’s nothing I really wanted to do in life that I wasn’t able to get good at. That’s my
                        skill. I’m not really specifically talented at anything except for the ability to learn. That’s
                        what I do. That’s what I’m here for. Don’t be afraid to be wrong because you can’t learn
                        anything from a compliment.
                        <br/><br/>

                        It really matters and then like it really doesn’t matter. What matters is the people who are
                        sparked by it. And the people who are like offended by it, it doesn’t matter. Because it's about
                        motivating the doers. Because I’m here to follow my dreams and inspire other people to follow
                        their dreams, too.

                        The time is now for it to be okay to be great. People in this world shun people for being great.
                        For being a bright color. For standing out. But the time is now to be okay to be the greatest
                        you. Would you believe in what you believe in, if you were the only one who believed it?
